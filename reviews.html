								<h2>Ryan with "Lucy"</h2>
								<p>Carol was amazing. We had a really anxious dog to start. With Carols help we were not only able to train basic commands, but she also helped us to increase Lucy's confidence with all sorts of different training. We have learned that a confident dog is a good dog. Lucy absolutely loves Carol and we would recommend her to anybody.</p>

								<h2>Heather with "Maddy"</h2>
								<p>Carol is amazing at what she does. We completed six sessions and our dog's behavior has improved tremendously. We look forward to booking more sessions. Carol not only provided exceptional training, she also identified that our dog has an anxiety disorder. Carol immediately identified her symptoms as anxiety and referred us to a specialist who confirmed the diagnosis. I would highly recommend C2 dog training. Carol is by far the best trainer I have ever worked with.</p>

								<h2>Mark with "Tina"</h2>
								<p>We used Carol for our new rescue, Tina, who needed training and help with socialization issues. Because of Carol's knowledge, patience, confidence, and ability to effectively educate, we have a well trained dog who is learning to get along well with people and other dogs. We are so appreciative for all of the help she gave us with Tina. We have a more peaceful home and better relationship with our dog because of Carol. Thank you Carol!!!!!</p>

								<p>Carol is fantastic to work with. She is calm and patient and great at teaching humans, as well as animals. She is helping us with generalized anxiety and severe car anxiety, which is very stressful for the humans and our dog. She has put "fun" back in our everyday lives while working towards our anxiety goals. I highly recommend her.</p>

										<h2>Laura with "Izzy"</h2>
						
										<p>I highly recommend Carol for any of your training needs. She is extremely knowledgeable and helped us SO much with our extremely anxious Shepherd. She responds very quickly to any questions that you have and is always asking for updates on how your dog is doing on days that you don't have training. She's extremely patient and I wish I met her months ago!</p>

										<h2>Angela with "Winston"</h2>
						
										<p>Where do I begin to describe the patience, knowledge, calming effect, compassion and trust that pours out of Carol...and that was just with me! üôÇ Now with my dog, Winston, she was amazing! Her observations of his behaviors, the way she handled him and actually loves him was and is so much more than I could have ever asked for in someone to guide myself and Winston to a family unit. Her guidance, suggestions and work with him (and me) has been a huge help. I would trust her with any dog and I highly recommend her. Carol truly has a love and passion for what she does and it shows in every session or contact I have with her. Thank you, Carol! Winston loves you!</p>

										<h2>Elaine with "Layla"</h2>
						
										<p>We can‚Äôt say enough good things about Carol and C2 Dog Training. Carol has helped us with our ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù Layla puppy turning her into a dog that can follow basic commands and become easier to deal with. Carol always makes each lesson fun for the dog as well as the owner. Layla just loves it when she comes over and is sad when she leaves. Carol has a wealth of knowledge about dogs. We owe her a debt of gratitude!</p>

								<div class="image"><img src="images/reviews/Tucker.jpg" alt="" /></div><div class="content">
										<h2>Rob with "Tucker"</h2>
						
										<p>I can't say enough positive things about Carol and C2 Dog Training! There's no better way to bond with your pup while having a great time than working with C2. The positive reinforcement training is a blast for my pup Tucker and for me while allowing us to work on everything from basic obedience, to agility, fitness, and parkour, and even behavioral issues. There's no pre-arranged plan that we are held to, C2 works with me and Tucker so we get the most focused training for our specific needs. I'm so happy with the results I've seen with Tucker and you know you're doing something right when you see how excited Tucker gets as soon as he sees Carol and knows we are about to start training.</p>

										<p>I consider training an ongoing process with no finite end. I always want to work with Tucker to better our bond and learn new skills that benefit both of us and I know I've found the right fit in C2 to continue this fun process with Tucker. I highly recommend reaching out to C2 if you're interested in training your pup in a fun and positive way!</p>

										<h2>Meaghan with "Rhaego"</h2>
						
										<p>Carol at C2 dog training is the best - I highly recommend her! She has fantastic patience and handle's each dog differently based on their personality and specific needs, and always uses positive reinforcement methods. Our dog has severe anxiety and is very fearful of new people. With Carol's help we've been working on behavior modification and basic obedience, and we've made great progress and seeing improvements with our dog, a 6 year-old pit-mix rescue. We are super happy and I can't recommend her enough!</p>

								<div class="image"><img src="images/reviews/Kota.jpg" alt="" /></div><div class="content">
										<h2>Nadia with "Kota"</h2>
								
										<p>I have a 3 year old Maltese that we rescued over a year ago. Two months ago he started having accidents in his crate and separation anxiety, which caused him to whine, howl and bark for hours. I was beyond frustrated because I couldn‚Äôt leave the house without coming home to accidents. Carol Creamer was recommended by my vet, thankfully Carol was able to see us the same week. Carol spent 3 hours with us...teaching me about canine behaviors and providing interactive training with me and our dog. Carol thought me simple commands and easy games to engage my dogs brain. It‚Äôs been 4 days since Carol came to the house and so far so good. Thank you Carol!</p>

								<div class="image"><img src="images/reviews/Mia.jpg" alt="" /></div><div class="content">
										<h2>Melanie with "Mia"</h2>
						
										<p>We rescued Mia a 2 yr old dachshund /Shiba Inu mix in April. She was very afraid of my husband even after 8 weeks so we hired Carol to help us. Carol provided us with a plethora of positive counter conditioning and desensitizing techniques and she suggested we meet with the behavior therapist doc. We implemented all of her suggestions as best we could with a VERY skiddish dog and we are seeing some positive results with our little Mia. She will now go on walks with my husband and will eat while he is in the same room with her. That‚Äôs a huge turn around from her barking and growling or running away as soon as he entered a room with her.</p>

										<p>Carol helped us to remain patient and hopeful with her encouragement and training advice. You can tell she truly loves animals and we appreciate her working with us and Mia! I highly recommend calling Carol to help you with your pup!</p>

										<h2>Steve with "Angelo"</h2>
										
										<p>We highly recommend Carol and C 2 Dog Training. She has given us the tools to understand our dog and modify his behavior. She was very supportive and encouraging..to us! It was amazing to see how she got our rambunctious pup to do everything she wanted him to do. She was very patient with him and he responded to her very well. This was an extremely positive experience for all of us and now it's up to us to continue with the methods Carol has shown us. She really loves her work and it shows! Angelo just loves her! Thanks again Carol!</p>

										<h2>Denise with "Rosa"</h2>
						
										<p>Attended my first SAR seminar with Rosa this weekend, and it was awesome! I wanted to thank you for working with us and doing all the fitness, agility, and parkour exercises.

									<h2>Karen with "Jet and Max"</h2>
									<p>I highly recommend Carol Creamer and C2 Dog Training for
										 puppies or adult dogs. After adding a second dog (puppy)
										 into our home suddenly, we contacted Carol for some basic
										 obedience and house-breaking help. Max was hand-shy and
										 fearful when he joined our family, and 13 weeks later
										 is friendly, playful and loves to be held. Carol was even
										 more helpful in addressing the needs of our older dog,
										 who suffers from anxiety and was having a hard time
										 with the transition. Her observations put us on the
										 path to get Jet additional help in managing and treating his
										 behavioral issues. He is a less anxious and happier dog
										 thanks to her help. Prior to working with C2, Jet would
										 rarely leave the property or take a walk, and had difficulty
										 riding in a car. We can now successfully take him on walks,
										 go to the park and enjoy car rides. Carol is very
										 knowledgeable and comes prepared with a game plan, equipment,
										 and great training tips. My dogs looked forward to her visits
										 and their treat jackpots! We are so grateful to have found C2
										 Dog Training!</p>

									<h2>Shyamoli with "Mister Bingley"</h2>
									<p>Loved Carol Creamer and her training methods. My dog Mister
										 Bingley is so different in 6 weeks. He is more obedient and
										 more attached to us. I can‚Äôt believe that with Carol‚Äôs
										 training he is actually getting into the car which was too
										 traumatic in the past. I know he has a long way to go but
										 using carol‚Äôs methods we will get there. Thank you so much
										 Carol, hope we stay in touch in the future.</p>

									<h2>Juliet with "Ruby" and "Leo" </h2>
									<p>I would highly recommend Carol and C2 Dog Training to
										anyone with dogs of any age. She is very knowledgeable and
										comes well prepared to every session with equipment,

										pet and owner to practice and implement into routine. She
										trains dogs and their owners with patience, positive

										gift with animals and you can tell she genuinely cares
										about what she is doing. Thank you Carol for a wonderful

									<h2>Bree with "Eeyore" and "Bailey"</h2>
									<p>C2 dog training has changed not only my relationship with
										my dog but made having a puppy a piece of cake. Prior to
										training he was very fear reactive every time our door bell
										would ring, would swallow anything he could pick up and
										would almost knock me over for his meals. Now he listens,
										waits for his meals and has manners. He is so confident now
										and loves showing off how smart he is. I highly recommend
										C2 dog training for all your dog training needs!</p>

										<p>Even though I already gave an excellent review of C2 I
											feel a need to thank Carol for her support and help.
											Carol goes beyond expectations to support us as new puppy
											parents and our puppy. I highly recommend C2 for
											training, whether for basic needs or tackling a difficult
											problem. C2 provides a ton of knowledge and understanding
											of dogs, making it easier for us to understand the
											process and work toward improvement. The training
											recommended is fun and makes sense! Carol is always
											available to answer questions or make suggestions. I
											really am so grateful for her support and true love for
